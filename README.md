# Last Minute: The RPG

## Overview

This project is being developed after it was created for the Simon Fraser University's Computing Science Student Society's Fall Hacks 2022 Hackathon. It includes a game engine written from scratch using SDL2.

## Installation

### Dependencies
This game is writtin in C, so a C compiler is needed. It then depends on the C math library, which is typically included either in a UNIX distribution or a C compiling environment. `make` is used for compilation. The SDL2 library is used and provides cross-platform support for video, audio, and keyboard interaction. Additionally, this game depends on the SDL2_mixer library for music and audio interfacing.

#### To install `make`:
- MacOS / Brew: `brew install make`
- Debian-based distributions: `apt install make`

#### To install SDL2:

- MacOS / Brew: `brew install sdl2`
- Debian-based distributions: `apt install libsdl2-dev`

#### To install SDL2_mixer:
